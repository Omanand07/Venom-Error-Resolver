# Venom-Error-Resolver
Venom-Error-Resolver is basically a tool which will help you encountering errors which you get in your daily life related to various programming languages or any kind of software or os error.The code just ask you to input the error you have got and then google the error in terminal itself and scrap all the results of stack overflow and then scrap all the answers given in each and every page of stack overflow for the particular error.ðŸ˜… I know this sounds pretty like shit but i think it is something which comes in handy while working as you got all the related answers to your error in a single go without googling it and then visiting each and every link for the related answers.ðŸ˜‚
